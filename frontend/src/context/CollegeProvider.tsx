/**
 * Lazy, resilient colleges/branches loader.
 *
 * Why this is structured the way it is:
 *
 * - The provider sits at the root of App.tsx so any descendant page can read
 *   `colleges` / `branches`. But pages like /login and the public landing
 *   pages don't need this data, and college-service is sometimes down in
 *   dev. Fetching eagerly meant every fresh page load fired a request that
 *   often 503'd and left the console full of errors — pure noise.
 *
 * - We now defer the fetch until something actually reads `colleges` or
 *   `branches`, and we don't infinitely retry: one quiet retry with
 *   backoff handles transient 503s (Bastion's stale "down" cache flips to
 *   "up" within seconds once college-service comes back). After that we
 *   expose the error so consumers can render an actionable message.
 *
 * - `refresh()` is exposed so a UI surface (e.g., the admin form's college
 *   dropdown) can offer a manual retry button without remounting the tree.
